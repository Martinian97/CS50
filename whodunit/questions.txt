1.  stdint.h is a header file to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types,
    together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
2.  These are data types which are essentially aliases for C/C++ primitive data types. They are all unsigned integers, so their first bit is not reserved for signing.
3.  1,4,4,2 bytes respectively.
4.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the character "M" in ASCII encoding.
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file whereas biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner. Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.    
7.  biBitCount
8.  It is possible you open more files than your OS allows. It means that the file might not exist or some permission error occurred while accessing a file such as 
    "Read-Only" or "Write-Protected", so in those cases fopen will return 0 (a NULL pointer).
9.  Beacuse we only need to read 1 element from the input file where each element is the size of the struct.
10. 3 
11. It's a file position indicator so that we can keep a track as to where we are in the file, like a cursor. If we lose track, then we can call this function.
12. Current position in the file. It is the third argument in fseek function.
