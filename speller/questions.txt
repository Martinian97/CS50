    the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe, it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we have defined as the largest word possible, 
    the word is ignored. If the word has a digit, it is ignored as well. If a word still exists, it is counted and checked for spelling. The amount of time it takes to complete
    the checking is updated in time_check. If it is misspelled then print word.
